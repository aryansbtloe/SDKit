# SDKit

SDKit is a set of useful classes, I have created while developing my apps. Please feel free to send a pull request and improve the repo.

Please [send me an email](mailto:steve@stevederico.com) if you are using SDKit in your project, I would love to hear about it.

## Usage
        
Example code & Photos for each class are available on the [SDKit Usage Page](https://github.com/stevederico/SDKit/wiki/Usage).
